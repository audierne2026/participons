The style of this illustration is a **clean, modern editorial cartoon / semi-realistic sketch** with a strong **newsroom / press conference vibe**. It’s the kind of drawing you commonly see in French or European newspapers (Le Monde, Libération, Le Canard enchaîné, L’Express) when they illustrate political or public figures in a slightly caricatured but still respectful way.

### Key visual characteristics (to reproduce in Lumalabs or similar tools)

1. **Line work & rendering**

   - Clean, confident black ink lines (no sketchy hatching, very controlled outlines).
   - Very light, subtle shading / cross-hatching only in places (cheeks, neck, hair).
   - Almost no heavy shadows → flat lighting, soft gradients.

2. **Color palette**

   - Very desaturated / muted overall (low saturation).
   - Skin tones are pale pink-beige, not realistic tan.
   - Main clothing colors: cool gray sweater, white shirt, very subdued blue/gray background.
   - Background uses soft warm yellow-green and cool gray-blue tones → institutional / neutral atmosphere.

3. **Facial features & caricature level**

   - Mild caricature: slightly enlarged glasses, prominent nose bridge, high forehead, thin lips → recognizable but not grotesque.
   - Expression is warm, open, slightly amused / confident (small smile, raised eyebrows).
   - Hair is simplified (soft gray waves, no individual strands).

4. **Composition & framing**

   - Tight medium shot on upper body and face (head + shoulders + gesturing hands).
   - Crowd blurred in the background with simple silhouettes + camera lenses / microphones → press scrum feeling.
   - Strong depth of field effect (foreground sharp, background soft).

5. **Overall mood & genre**
   - Journalistic, slightly ironic / affectionate caricature.
   - Professional yet humanizing (not aggressive satire).
   - “Le Monde diplomatique” / “Courrier international” editorial cartoon style.
